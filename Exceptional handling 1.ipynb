    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference,between Exceptions and syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans1- In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. \n",
    "When an exceptional condition or error occurs, Python raises an exception, which can then be handled and managed by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are typically caused by factors such as incorrect input, faulty logic, or unexpected conditions. \n",
    "They allow the program to handle error situations gracefully and provide appropriate feedback or take necessary actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors are mistakes in the structure of the Python code.\n",
    "They occur when the interpreter encounters code that does not conform to the language's syntax rules. \n",
    "Syntax errors prevent the program from running altogether. \n",
    "They usually arise from typos, missing or misplaced punctuation, or incorrect indentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between exceptions and syntax errors are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Occurrence: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors are detected by the interpreter before the\n",
    "program begins executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact on program execution: When an exception occurs, it interrupts the normal flow of the program and requires special handling \n",
    "to avoid termination. \n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, prevent the program from running at all until the errors are fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error type: Exceptions represent a wide range of error conditions that can occur during program execution. \n",
    "They can be specific exceptions like 'ZeroDivisionError' or 'FileNotFoundError', or they can be custom exceptions defined by the \n",
    "programmer. \n",
    "Syntax errors, however, indicate violations of the Python language syntax and are generally limited to issues like incorrect syntax, \n",
    "indentation, or misspelled keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to respond appropriately to exceptional \n",
    "situations. Syntax errors cannot be caught or handled directly; they must be fixed by correcting the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are runtime errors that occur during program execution, while syntax errors are detected by the interpreter before\n",
    "the program runs and indicate issues with the code's structure and adherence to the Python syntax rules."

    "Q5. What are Custom Exceptions in python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 5- \n",
    "In Python, custom exceptions are user-defined exceptions that allow us to create our own error types based on specific conditions\n",
    "or situations in our code. While Python provides a wide range of built-in exceptions for handling common errors, \n",
    "custom exceptions give you the flexibility to handle exceptional cases that are specific to our program or application.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why we might need to create custom exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Specific Error Handling: Custom exceptions allow us to differentiate between different types of errors and handle them in specific ways. \n",
    "By defining custom exceptions, we can provide more informative error messages and perform specialized error handling operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Code Readability and Maintainability: By using custom exceptions, we can make our code more readable and maintainable. \n",
    "Custom exceptions provide a clear indication of the possible errors that can occur in a particular context,\n",
    "making it easier for other developers (including ourself) to understand and maintain the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Abstraction and Encapsulation: Custom exceptions help us encapsulate error-handling logic within our code. \n",
